I am a PhD student with the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I conduct research on security and privacy in internet based systems. I have a specific focus on authentication and recovery of online services.

My recent research has involved computational social science and algorithmic fairness. I have been exploring equity in government services and the characteristics of good-faith online discussions.
