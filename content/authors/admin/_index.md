I am a PhD student associated with the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where I'm advised by [Chris Kanich](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/). I conduct research on security and privacy in internet based systems. I have a specific focus on the social aspects of usability and trust in online services.

I completed my MSc in Computer Science from Dalhousie University in Aug 2019, where I was supervised by [Dr. Srinivas Sampalli](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~srini).
