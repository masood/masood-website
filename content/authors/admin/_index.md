I am a PhD student with the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I focus on evaluating the security and privacy mechanisms of web browsers and web applications. My research has resulted in the discovery of severe practical privacy flaws that stem from the design and implementation of major frameworks and mechanisms. Through my work I aim to assist developers and researchers in identifying the privacy implications of their deployments for end users, and help them develop robust countermeasures.
